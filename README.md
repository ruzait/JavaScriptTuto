## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **lightweight, interpreted programming language** primarily used for:
- Adding interactivity to websites.
- Building web, mobile, and desktop applications.
- Server-side development with platforms like **Node.js**.

### Key Facts:
- Developed by **Brendan Eich** in 1995.
- Works alongside HTML and CSS for web development.
- Executed in web browsers or environments like Node.js.

---

## Features of JavaScript

- **Lightweight and Fast**: Executes code directly in the browser.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold different types of data.
- **Event-Driven**: Responds to user actions like clicks or keystrokes.
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports objects, prototypes, and inheritance.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on all major browsers and operating systems.

---

## How JavaScript Works

1. JavaScript code is embedded in HTML and runs in the browser.
2. Browsers have JavaScript engines (like **V8** for Chrome) that interpret and execute JavaScript code.
3. JavaScript interacts with:
   - The **DOM (Document Object Model)** to manipulate web pages.
   - **APIs** for advanced functionalities like geolocation, storage, etc.

## Getting Started with JavaScript

### Requirements
1. A text editor like **Visual Studio Code**.
2. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

# How to Run JavaScript in VS Code

Follow these steps to execute JavaScript code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

---

## 1. Install Node.js
Node.js is required to run JavaScript outside the browser.

- Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify the installation:
  ```bash
  node -v

## 2. Install VS Code
- Download and install VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 3. Set Up Your JavaScript File
- Open VS Code.
- Create a new folder for your project and open it in VS Code.
- Create a new file with a `.js` extension (e.g., `script.js`)

## 4. Write Your JavaScript Code
- Write your JavaScript code in the `.js` file. Example:
```javascript
    console.log("Hello, World!");
```


## 5. Run the JavaScript File
- Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + /` (backtick) or navigating to `View` > `Terminal`.
- Type `node script.js` and press Enter to run the JavaScript file.
```bash
   node script.js
```
- You can also use the `Run Code` button in the top right corner of the VS Code
